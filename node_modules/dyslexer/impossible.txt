Seems rather impossible to simplify this.

The seperate scope modules makes it a bit verbose to write a lexer.

It would be much nicer if it could be defined using json/yaml or something.

It would be nice if there was a visual interface, showing the needle and the
scope switching. I think just a delay in reading, at human speed would be useful.

Explains it better than documentation.
